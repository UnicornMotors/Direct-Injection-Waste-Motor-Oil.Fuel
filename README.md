# Direct-Injection-Waste-Motor-Oil.Fuel
With direct injection, the fuel pressure is adjustable by a computer! IF you were to Increase the size &amp; number of holes in the Injector Nozzle, Lower the pressure of the fuel pump, and Heat the oil - you can likely operate without causing any damage!

# Software modification:
With Common Rail & HEUI (Hydraulic Electronic Fuel Injection) I can change the EMC software to lower the Injection pressure!

For this a PowerStroke is ideal!

Fix up a cheap:
- PowerStroke 7.3
- PowerStroke 6.0
for testing!
